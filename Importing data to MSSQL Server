      2. Run the following SQL command:
             CREATE DATABASE Insurancedb;
      3.Refresh the left-side Object Explorer to confirm the database is created.


Step 3: Import the Dataset into SQL Server

      1.Right-click on the newly created Insurancedb.
      2.Go to: Tasks â†’ Import Flat File.
      3.Click Next, and browse for your dataset file:

      4.While importing:
          Update PolicyNumber column data type from money to VARCHAR (or nvarchar) manually.
      5.Click Next, then Finish, and Close once the import is successful.

Step 4: Query the Imported Table
      1.After importing, run the command:

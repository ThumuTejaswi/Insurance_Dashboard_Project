After loading and preparing the data in Power BI, the next step was to design an interactive and insightful dashboard using different visuals.

1. Added Title & Slicers
    - **Title Text Box**: “PRISM INSURANCE PVT. LTD.”
    - **Slicers Used**:

These slicers allow users to filter data across the entire report.


2. KPI Cards
    - **Premium Amount**

These KPIs show a quick overview of the company’s performance in terms of revenue and payouts.

    - **Male**: 5003
    - **Female**: 5001


4. Bar Chart
    **Premium Amount by Policy Type**  
    - Shows how much premium is collected from each policy type (e.g., Travel, Health, Auto, etc.).


5. Column Chart
    **Number of Claims by Claim Status**  
    - Categories: Rejected, Settled, Pending  
    - Helps track the current status of all claims filed.


6. Line Chart
    **Claim Amount by Age Group**  
    - Age groups: Young, Adult, Elder  
    - Shows which age group is filing more claims and the total claim amount.


7. Donut Chart

    - Helps visualize customer engagement and policy activity status.


8. Matrix Table
